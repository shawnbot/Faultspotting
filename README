Faultspotting: U.S. Earthquakes on maps

All this does is get data right now. To update automatically, add the following
line to your crontab:

0 * * * * cd {PATH_TO_FAULTSPOTTING} && ./update.sh 2>&1 >> log.txt

replacing, obviously, {PATH_TO_FAULTSPOTTING} with the full path to your
faultspotting checkout.

This will do a few things every hour:

1. Pull the latest set of hourly US quake data from
   earthquake.usgs.gov, and place it in a CSV file named
   according to the current (system) date and time:
   "data/%Y%m%d.%H.csv"
2. Copy the latest dated CSV to "data/latest.csv"
3. Append latest hourly data to a master CSV file: "data/all.csv"
4. Generate GeoJSON versions of the latest and master sets:
   "data/latest.json" and "data/all.json"
